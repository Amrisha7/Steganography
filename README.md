## Project Description

This project implements steganography techniques to hide secret messages within image files. It provides a simple and interactive way to encode and decode messages within images.

## Features

- Encoding of secret messages into images.
- Decoding of hidden messages from images.
- Graphical Useer interface for easy interaction and better visualisation.

## Demo

When you run the code the steps will be like the following: 
1) Click on the "*Open Image*" button.
2) Choose the "*logo.jpg*" image.
3) Then in the text field write down any text. Afterthat click on "*Hide Data*", then "*Save Image*".
4) The next step will be to give the code a fresh run again.
5) Click on "*Open Image*" and then select the encrypted image which will be auto-generated after hiding the text in the image, the name of this image will be "*hidden.png*" in this case.
6) Then click on the "*Show Data*" button to retrieve the hidden text.

##  Usage

The usage of your steganography project is to hide and extract secret messages within image files. Users can utilize your steganography tool for various purposes, such as privacy, security, or just for fun. Here's a breakdown of how users can use your steganography project:

### Use Case

*Privacy and Confidentiality*: Users can use your steganography tool to send sensitive information or messages privately. By embedding messages within images, they can share information discreetly without drawing attention.

*Security*: Steganography can be used as a form of digital watermarking or data protection. Users can watermark images with ownership information or use it for copyright protection.

*Fun and Challenges*: Some users might use your steganography tool for fun, puzzles, or challenges. They can encode and decode messages as part of a game or interactive experience.

*Education and Learning*: Your project can serve as an educational tool for learning about steganography techniques and how they work.

## Conclusion

The Image Steganography project is a Python-based tool designed to explore the world of steganography, offering an interactive platform to encode and decode secret messages within image files. While this code is currently a work in progress and requires further development to enable steganography operations, it serves as an educational and practical foundation for understanding:

### Graphical User Interface (GUI): 
The creation of a user-friendly interface using tkinter for image selection, message input, and steganography operations.
### Image Processing:
Utilization of the PIL library for image handling, displaying, and potential modification.
### Steganography Techniques:
Introduction to the concept of hiding text messages within image files using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method.
### Software Integration:
The incorporation of multiple libraries and modules to build a cohesive software application.
### User Interaction:
Implementing widgets for user input and interaction in the application.
### Error Handling:
The importance of implementing robust error handling for smooth and reliable operation.

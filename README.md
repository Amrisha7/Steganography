## Project Description

This project implements steganography techniques to hide secret messages within image files. It provides a simple and interactive way to encode and decode messages within images.

## Features

- Encoding of secret messages into images.
- Decoding of hidden messages from images.
- Command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Demo

When you run the code the outcome after choosing the option will be asking you the image path where you want to hide the secret message and the path of the image after hiding the same.

##  Usage
The usage of your steganography project is to hide and extract secret messages within image files. Users can utilize your steganography tool for various purposes, such as privacy, security, or just for fun. Here's a breakdown of how users can use your steganography project:

## Encoding a Secret Message
*Select an Image*: Users can choose an image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG) that will serve as the carrier for the hidden message. This image should be the one in which the message will be concealed.

*Enter a Message*: Users input the secret message they want to hide within the selected image. This message can be anything they want to keep private or share discreetly.

*Specify an Output Image*: Users provide the path and filename for the output image. This is where the secret message will be embedded. The output image will look identical to the original one, but it will contain the hidden message.

*Run the Encoding Process*: Users run your steganography tool to encode the message into the image. The tool uses steganographic techniques to hide the message within the image without making it visually apparent.

## Decoding a Hidden Message
*Select an Image with a Hidden Message*: Users choose an image that they suspect contains a hidden message. This image should be one that was previously encoded using your steganography tool.

*Run the Decoding Process*: Users run your steganography tool to extract the hidden message from the selected image. The tool analyzes the image and retrieves the concealed message.

*View the Decoded Message*: After the decoding process is complete, users can view the hidden message. They can now read or use the message for its intended purpose.

### Encoding a Message
python steganography.py encode -i input_image.png -m "This is a secret message" -o output_image.png

### Decoding a Message
python steganography.py decode -i encoded_image.png

## Use Case
*Privacy and Confidentiality*: Users can use your steganography tool to send sensitive information or messages privately. By embedding messages within images, they can share information discreetly without drawing attention.

*Security*: Steganography can be used as a form of digital watermarking or data protection. Users can watermark images with ownership information or use it for copyright protection.

*Fun and Challenges*: Some users might use your steganography tool for fun, puzzles, or challenges. They can encode and decode messages as part of a game or interactive experience.

*Education and Learning*: Your project can serve as an educational tool for learning about steganography techniques and how they work.
